# XMPP Notifications Plugin for Redmine

This plugin is intended to provide integration with XMPP messenger (Jabber).

Following actions will result in notifications to Jabber:

- Create and update issues
- Edit a wiki page
- Create a new board topic or comment a topic

Following commands hardcoded into the bot (underscores and angle brackets here for logical grouping purposes only):
- `+#XXXXX <any_message_you_want_to_set_as_comment_for_issue_number_XXXXX>`
- `.#XXXXX <new_status_for_issue_number_XXXXX>`
  + statuses are: `not`, `yet`, `decided`
- `!# <description> +<project_name_substring_or_id> [!<assigned_to>]* [@<watcher>]*`
  + if `assigned_to` is not specified issue will be assigned to the user who sent command
  + `project_name_substring_or_id` can contain spaces. In that case it should be surrounded in `"double quotes"`

## Installation & Configuration

- Then install the Plugin following the general Redmine [plugin installation instructions](http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Plugins).
- The XMPP Notifications Plugin depends on the [Xmpp4r](https://xmpp4r.github.io/). This can be installed with `bundler` in top Redmine directory:
```ShellSession
cd <redmine_installation_directory>
bundle install
```
- Go to the Plugins section of the Administration page, select Configure.
- On this page fill out the Jabber ID and password for user who will send messages.
- If you want bot to go online when Redmine starts set `XMPP_BOT_STARTUP` environment variable to any value.
- Restart your Redmine web servers (e.g. mongrel, thin, mod_rails).

## Sidekiq Support

If you install the [redmine_sidekiq](https://github.com/ogom/redmine_sidekiq) plugin along with this one, you can configure the XMPP notification bot to perform in the background Sidekiq worker process.

After the installation just switch to the background processing by ticking a checkbox at the plugin configuration page.

Don't forget to start Sidekiq along with Rails, e.g. like this:

```
bundle exec sidekiq -d -L log/sidekiq.log
```

#### Sidekiq and Ruby 2.2

If you for whatever reason can't upgrade to Ruby higher than 2.2, you can still use Sidekiq with this plugin. But for that you'll have to force usage of older versions of Sidekiq and Redis gems, but adding to your `Gemfile.local` in redmine root:

```ruby
gem "sidekiq", "~> 4.2.10"
gem "redis", "~> 3.3.5"
```
Also comment out or delete first line in `plugins/redmine_sidekiq/Gemfile` in order to avoid version conflict for Sidekiq:

```ruby
#gem 'sidekiq'
gem 'sinatra'
```

## TODO
- Allow notifications to be sent after using bot commands
- ~~Move all bot logic into background process (possibly via `Sidekiq`) and use them via asynchronous background jobs~~
- Make all commands configurable via Web interface.
- Add possibility to deliver notifications in MUC(s?). refs: https://github.com/redmine-xmpp/notifications/issues/13 and https://github.com/YunoHost/redmine_xmpp_muc_notifications
- Add possibility to choose whether notifications should be deliver to only MUC(s?) or both in MUC(s) and with direct messages.
